<p>Welcome to Rocket11ty! A simple yet elegant 11ty tepmlate. But, why not other 11ty templates?</p>
<p>Out of the box it contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Caching</li>
<li>PWAs so your blog can be installed like an app</li>
<li>Mobile Friendly design</li>
<li>Light and Dark theme. (Provided by <a href="https://www.gethalfmoon.com/">Halfmoon.</a>)</li>
<li>A contact form (Only on Netlify)</li>
<li>Built-in sitemap</li>
<li>RSS feed for your blog.</li>
<li>NetlifyCMS to easily publish your blog (only on Netlify)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the blog system/sitemap/RSS feed was provided by the base template which can be found <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">here.</a> because, why recreate something that already works?</p>
<p>The source code can be located <a href="https://github.com/aboutDavid/rocket11ty"> here</a></p>
