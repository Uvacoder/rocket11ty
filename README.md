Welcome to Rocket11ty, a very simple yet elegant 11ty template.

Features: 
- Automatic caching (Credit: @khalby786) 
- PWAs so your blog can be installed like an app (Credit: @khalby786) 
- Mobile Friendly design
- Light and Dark theme. (Provided by <a href="https://www.gethalfmoon.com/">Halfmoon.</a>)
- A contact form that works (Only on Netlify, however can be make to work with [Pageclip](https://pageclip.co/))
- An automatic SEO (a sitemap, RSS feed, etc)
- NetlifyCMS to easily publish your blog (only on Netlify)
- Made with the JAMstack idea so your blog can easily be published to a CDN (e.g. Netlify) unlike WordPress.

Some parts of this blog (e.g. the blog system, the sitemap, and the RSS feed) came from [11ty's base template](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) because why remake something that is already good?
